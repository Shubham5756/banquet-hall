Place your banquet background image here.

Filename: `banquet.jpg`

- Smaller screens: provide responsive srcsets or use a single large image and rely on `object-fit`/`background-size: cover`.

Example path used in CSS: `images/banquet.jpg`

To replace the temporary background, add your image file to this folder with the exact filename above.
